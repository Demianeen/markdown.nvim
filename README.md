# markdown.nvim

Tools to make working with markdown in Neovim more enjoyable. Very WIP.

---

Plans:

- table of contents
- section numbering
- improved list editing:
  - auto insertion of new list items
  - auto indent/dedent new list items
- improved multi-line block quote editing (auto-insert)
- inline-style keybindings
- link/image pasting from clipboard
- format tables (gfm)
